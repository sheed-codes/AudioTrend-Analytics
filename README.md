# AudioTrend-Analytics
AudioTrend Analytics is a Python-based analytics pipeline designed to detect emerging music trends using the Spotify Web API.  Instead of simply pulling track data, this project builds a lightweight "signal engine" that analyzes release recency, cross-query presence, and preview availability to generate a custom trend score for tracks.
